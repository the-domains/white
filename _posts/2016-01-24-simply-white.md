The table nowadays is a melting pot of 
different cultures, customs and traditions. The contemporary palate 
seeks increasing involvement in multiethnic culinary experiences and the
dining table is the physical space for meetings and exchanges. This is 
the driving concept behind À Table, a new collection of objects and 
accessories for the table -- plates, bowls, glasses, baskets, carafes, 
cutting boards, cutlery and linen -- designed by 

for 

and to be previewed at 

, Paris, from 23 to 27 January 2015\.

Entirely Made in Italy, À Table is 
inspired by the food habits and nationalities of the young creatives at 
Fabrica. The designers took their inspiration from countries such as 
China, Egypt, England, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, 
Morocco and Scotland. The result is an eclectic yet coherent collection 
in which, thanks to a strict design, different materials (ceramic, wood,
metal, glass and fabric) are used seamlessly and in which every single 
detail is studied to coordinate the various pieces both aesthetically 
and in their daily use.

The product 
catalogue had to be sent to print when half of the prototypes haven't 
been ready yet to take pictures from. There was a need for quick renders
which are printed in the final catalogue. 

After also the photographs (by Marco Zanin) have been taken, Marlene 
created renders with the same arrangement to challenge realism in 
photography and computer generated images in 3D - see the two pictures
